# Greenpeace Planet 4 technical documentation

![Planet4](./planet4.png)

This repository holds the technical documentation for the Planet 4 project.\
All changes automatically sync bi-directionally with Gitbook.

[planet4.greenpeace.org/tech-docs](https://app.gitbook.com/@greenpeace/s/planet4/)

For docs to be fetched from external repos, we add them as submodules under `repos/`. And we can periodically syn by running the `sync-repos.sh` script.
