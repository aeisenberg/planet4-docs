# ADRs

We use ADRs \(Architectural Decision Records\) to document important architectural decisions. For a good explanation on what an ADR is see [https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture\_decision\_record](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record).

You can access our current ADRs at [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WyI5qWVHPvavO6HaTEr8xKyWPX8ZgC1p](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WyI5qWVHPvavO6HaTEr8xKyWPX8ZgC1p).
