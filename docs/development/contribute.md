## Development

Planet 4 consists of many repositories, for all the themes and plugins we develop:

* [planet4-master-theme](https://github.com/greenpeace/planet4-master-theme)
* [planet4-plugin-gutenberg-blocks](https://github.com/greenpeace/planet4-plugin-gutenberg-blocks)
* [planet4-plugin-medialibrary](https://github.com/greenpeace/planet4-plugin-medialibrary)
* [planet4-plugin-gutenberg-engagingnetworks](https://github.com/greenpeace/planet4-plugin-gutenberg-engagingnetworks)
* [planet4-styleguide](https://github.com/greenpeace/planet4-styleguide)

![Our code repositories built the platform we call Planet 4](../.gitbook/assets/p4-code-structure%20%281%29.png)

Now pick the one you want to work on, and if you don't have write access to it, fork it on Github.

## Pull Requests

Before working on something or opening a Pull Request, please make sure that there is a relevant issue:

* If a relevant issue already exists, leave a comment that you are interested in working on that.
* If no relevant issue exists, open a new one and initiate the discussion.

The tickets labeled as [Contribution](https://jira.greenpeace.org/issues/?jql=status%20%3D%20Open%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20contribution) are a good starting point for start coding.

All Pull Requests should target the `master` branch. Make sure to reference the relevant issue in your Pull Request description and follow our [git guidelines](git-guidelines.md).

## Coding

In general we try to stick as close as possible to [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/). The best approach to make sure your code is following planet4â€™s coding style is to use code linters. Most code editors have integrations and plugins for linting the code in realtime. We already have linter configuration in our repositories. Here is a list of the linters we use:

* PHP: [PHP\_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)
* Javascript: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
* CSS/Sass: [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)

## Code Of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open, inclusive and welcoming environment, our project is following a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct).
