# Deployment

In our current approach of hosting, each NRO gets automatically three sites:

* A _**develop**_ site, at k8s.greenpeace.org/&lt;nro&gt;
* A _**staging**_ site, at release.k8s.greenpeace.org/&lt;nro&gt;
* A _**production**_ site, at master.k8s.greenpeace.org/&lt;nro&gt; \(and of course, after the site goes live, at the designated live url\)
